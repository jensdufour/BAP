Throughout the following pages I will research the question: "What are the advantages and disadvantages of a migration from Windows Server 2016 to 2019 in a business environment?". This bachelor's thesis was written in the context of my graduation at the University College Ghent where I studied Applied Computer Sciences and by order of Delaware, where I researched and wrote my bachelor's thesis from February 2019 till May 2019.

In consultation with my promoter, Ludwig Stroobant, and my co-promoter, Glenn Verschuere, the research question was formulated as the basis. For the duration of this assignment, they were always there to answer the questions I had in regard to the research. 

I would like to thank them in particular. Without them this would not have been possible.
Furthermore, I would like to give a special thanks to Delaware and in particular Tomas Castro and Jonas Decoster. Without their effort, I never would have had the opportunity to do this research from their branch in Harbin, China. I would also like to thank Henry Hao and Cici Chen for their hospitality and guidance during my stay, it was an experience I will never forget and always be grateful for. 

Finally, I would like to thank my parents in particular. Their wisdom and motivating words have helped me to bring this bachelor's thesis to a successful conclusion.

I wish you a lot of reading pleasure.
